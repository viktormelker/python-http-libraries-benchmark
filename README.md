# 🐍 python-http-libraries-benchmark

This project benchmarks popular Python HTTP libraries to compare their performance across core networking metrics. The goal is to offer insights on how each library performs under real-world request loads.

## 📦 HTTP Libraries Benchmarked
This benchmark includes widely-used Python HTTP libraries chosen for their relevance, diversity, and real-world usage. `requests` is the most popular and beginner-friendly library, while `urllib3` offers low-level control and powers `requests` internally. `httpx`, `httpx2`, `niquests`, and `aiohttp` provide modern HTTP client APIs. `httpx`, `httpx2`, and `niquests` are measured in both sync and async modes (as `*_sync` and `*_async` series). Finally, `pycurl` wraps the high-performance C-based libcurl library.

- [`aiohttp`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/)
- [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/) (sync and async)
- [`httpx2`](https://httpx2.pydantic.dev/) (sync and async)
- [`niquests`](https://niquests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (sync and async)
- [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/)
- [`urllib3`](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/)
- [`pycurl`](http://pycurl.io/)

## 📊 Metrics Captured

Each library is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Requests per Second (`req/sec`)**: Measures throughput. A higher number indicates the library handles more traffic efficiently.
- **Total Time**: Measures how long the library takes to complete a full batch of requests.
- **Average Connection Time**: Indicates the average time spent on establishing connections for each request.

These metrics are chosen to reflect practical usage in applications such as REST APIs, microservices, and integrations.

## 🎯 Benchmarking Strategy

To ensure fair and unbiased comparisons:

- Each run sends a fixed number of requests (`NUM_REQUESTS = 100`) to a local HTTP server (`http://localhost` by default).
- The script performs **101 complete benchmark runs**, where the first is used as warm-up and excluded from the CSV output.
- **Randomized Execution Order**: For every run, the order in which HTTP libraries are tested is randomized. This prevents any one library from benefiting from system or network caching effects due to consistent positioning.

---

## 📁 Output

Benchmark results are stored in `benchmark_results.csv`. Each row represents one full benchmarking round and includes:

- Start and end timestamps
- Requests per second, total duration, and average connection time for each library (httpx, httpx2, and niquests appear as both `_sync` and `_async` columns)
- Number of requests executed

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Install requirements:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Start a local HTTP server** (in a separate terminal):

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

3. **Run the benchmark:**

```bash
BENCHMARK_URL=http://localhost:8080 python benchmark.py
```

4. **Generate charts:**

```bash
python benchmark_analytics.py
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BENCHMARK_URL` | `http://localhost` | Target URL for requests |
| `BENCHMARK_RUNS` | `101` | Total number of runs (first is warm-up) |

Example with custom values:
```bash
BENCHMARK_URL=http://localhost:8080 BENCHMARK_RUNS=11 python benchmark.py
```

## ⚙️ CI

A GitHub Actions workflow runs the benchmark automatically every Sunday and commits updated results and charts back to the repository. It can also be triggered manually via the **Actions** tab, with optional inputs for Python version and number of runs.
